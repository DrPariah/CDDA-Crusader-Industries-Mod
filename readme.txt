Introduction:
Originally intended only for personal use, this mod has been revised and released. Balance is questionable, but mods generally are. Ultimately, I wanted laser
and plasma weapons in the game, and since the base game already features things like advanced bionics and robots, these weapons seemed plausible. For better or for
worse, they're also already in the game. In order to maintain consistency with game lore, the new additions were thus prototype weapons from a fictional company,
Crusader Industries. Since the game also leans closer to real-world physics as opposed to the sci-fi artistic license, I've solved both issues by simply claiming
that it's "hybrid plasma," and the rest is a trade secret. These weapons never spawn anywhere, they must be built after finding the relevant books.

Small Arms:
Lasers
Rifle, carbine, pistol, and underslung pistol.

All run off of rechargable battery power, but with limited capacity, allowing a more conventional feel for reloading weapons in a fight. They have high accuracy and
power, as well as incredibly low recoil. For balance, they have absolutely no armor penetration capacity whatsoever, so even a .22 can be be more effective in
certain situations. Also, batteries themselves are comparable in size and weight to conventional magazines.

Plasma
Jezzail, autorifle, SMG, pistol, and underslung pistol variants.
They are a bit like a poor man's .50 caliber, though with splash damage and crappy capacity. They fall into two groups, cells and microcells. The jezzail, pistol,
and underslung pistol use the larger cells, firing a single shot at once, but also allowing the user to manually remove a discharged cell in a similar way to a
revolver. Because of splash damage, they can be potentially dangerous to the user should the target get too close. The autorifle and SMG have automatic and
burst-fire capacity, but their rounds also do less damage. In addition, they require weapon-specific magazines which must be built by the player character.

Heavy Weapons and Vehicles
Plasma Cannon and Laser Cannon.

The plasma cannon is exactly what it sounds like, though as appropriate for a vehicle mounted weapon it must be set up before firing. It also requires a specific
magazine, like the autorifle and SMG, but fires the larger rounds like the jezzail and pistols. It is also the only plasma weapon that automatically ejects the larger
cells. It can also be fitted to a vehicle turret.

The laser cannon actually comes in two variants, one to be carried around by the player and the other fitted to a vehicle. This is partially because of how vehicles
handle power. The first variant operates like most other heavy weapons requiring special terrain and a magazine. The second one must be fitted to a vehicle and charged
before it can fire, and will automatically recharge so long as the vehicle is generating power. This implies that if the vehicle is on with an alternator or generating
charge through reactors or solar panels then the weapon will also generate shots. Fortunately, it cannot draw power from the vehicle batteries themselves, so there is
no fear of accidentally killing the car battery when fleeing from zombie hordes. Another quirk is that it actually can be fired when not attached the vehicle, but it
cannot be reloaded or recharged. Hence, it is possible to attach it to the vehicle, charge it, remove it, and then carry it around like most other heavy weapons.

Gun Mods
The hyperbeam mod is the only one worth considering at the moment, outside of underslung pistols, which can be attached to anything. I have attempted to write a
few things that change ammunition types or magazines, but these have been redacted due to changes in the CDDA core game. Likewise, they may be revived or revised when
the core game itself changes. The code remains, but whether or not it is functional is dependent on CDDA itself changing. Since the game featured a few similar
conversions, mostly around shotguns and AR-15s, it's possible that this will be revived as well.

Bandoliers
Initially implemented to allow the player quick access to plasma cells, the execution is dependent on CDDA base code and encumbrance. Between this and player build,
it may or may not serve that purpose. It's there if you want it, but won't kill the game if it doesn't operate as intended. Like the other items in this mod, it can
only be built; unlike the other items, it doesn't require unusual skills. If you can make conventional bandoliers, you should be able to make these as well. Currently,
they only fit plasma cells, so they're only useful if you intend on using the jezzail or pistols.

Books
There are two books in this mod, both of which require high skills to read, but in turn will grant the crafting capacity for these weapons. They will spawn in labs
and also in places where textbooks appear, like libraries. I have considered re-balancing both the books themselves as well as their spawning.

Crafting
The mod introduces two new proficiencies required to build the weapons and are currently the only way to acquire the weapons. Crafting generally requires higher skills
and silly amounts of tools and resources. Balance may be questionable, but not unreasonable.

Martial Arts
Most weapons are compatible with Krav Maga. "Most" means all of them with the exception of the cannons and the jezzail. Given that the historic dimensions of a jezzail
is comparable to an American long rifle taller than the people carrying them, it seems a bit of a strech to use a jezzail in closer quarters as a Krav Maga weapon.
The dimensions favor Sojutsu, but it seems unrealistic to allow it without first attaching a bayonet. Because these exceptions cannot be handled in CDDA's handling
of martial arts, this is where it ends for the time being.

Job/Class
The Prototype Military Contractor has been added for those just wanting to jump in and see how lasers perform. Balance will always remain an issue with games in
general, but this appears justified as the base game already has some heavy-hitting gun-based jobs. It's important to notice that, unless you're able to find a
renewable power source, the ammunition you start with is all that you're going to get any time soon.

Future Additions and Conclusion
There have been a number of ideas I've played around with, but haven't implemented. Based on user feedback I may or may not extend the arsenal or build more companies
with a similar template but different ideology; this means perhaps a company using gunpowder weapons that are compatible with martial arts or a company that focuses
on robotics and electronic warfare. Thanks for reading this, and I hope you enjoy the mod I've built.
